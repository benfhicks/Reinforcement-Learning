# Reinforcement Learning
This is a repo where I set about learning the ins and outs of reinforcement learning.

I'll start by building a noughts and crosses game in Python, and solving it via Deep Learning, following this I'll look into Q-Learning for the same problem.

After solving noughts and crosses, I'll move onto Connect 4 and other games.
